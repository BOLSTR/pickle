module Pickle
  # Pickle creates a new adapter instance for each 'factory name' that is used.  The adapter instance has
  # responsibility for making new models, and for finding models.
  #
  # The finding responsibilities are handled by OrmAdapter
  #
  # The creating repsonsibilities differ depending on the factory farmework you are using.  Pickle provides:
  #
  # @see pickle/adapters/machinist
  # @see pickle/adapters/factory_girl
  # @see pickle/adapters/orm
  #
  # To create a new adapter:
  #  * it must set @model_class, and @name on initialization
  #  *Â it must implement the public method #make
  #  * if it is set as a Pickle::Config.adapter_class, then it must implement the class method #adapters that returns all of its adapter instances
