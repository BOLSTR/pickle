module NavigationHelpers
  # Maps a static name to a static route.
  #
  # This method is *not* designed to map from a dynamic name to a 
  # dynamic route like <tt>post_comments_path(post)</tt>. For dynamic 
  # routes like this you should *not* rely on #path_to, but write 
  # your own step definitions instead. Example:
  #
  #   Given /I am on the comments page for the "(.+)" post/ |name|
  #     post = Post.find_by_name(name)
  #     visit post_comments_path(post)
  #   end
  #
  def path_to(page_name)
    case page_name
    
    when /the homepage/
      root_path
    
    # Add more page name => path mappings here
    
    # added by script/generate pickle path

    when /^#{capture_model}(?:'s)? page$/                           # eg. the forum's page
      path_to_pickle $1

    when /^#{capture_model}(?:'s)? #{capture_model}(?:'s)? page$/   # eg. the forum's post's page
      path_to_pickle $1, $2

    when /^#{capture_model}(?:'s)? #{capture_model}'s (.+?) page$/  # eg. the forum's post's comments page
      path_to_pickle $1, $2, :extra => $3                           #  or the forum's post's edit page

    when /^#{capture_model}(?:'s)? (.+?) page$/                     # eg. the forum's posts page
      path_to_pickle $1, :extra => $2                               #  or the forum's edit page

    when /^the (.+?) page$/                                         # translate to named route
      send "#{$1.downcase.gsub(' ','_')}_path"
  
    # end added by pickle path
